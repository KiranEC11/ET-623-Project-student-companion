MalariaX: Defeating Malaria from the Genes to the Globe,Harvard University,"How can we eradicate malaria? Explore the scientific and technological underpinnings of malaria, as well as the historical, political, social, and economic contexts in which control, elimination, and eradication efforts unfold.Through foundational lectures and supplemental interviews, this course provides participants with a toolbox of knowledge and skills. Learners will be guided through the analysis of real-world data and its effective use in problem-solving. Analytical approaches focus on how to develop and implement evidence-based intervention strategies to contribute to national and local malaria eradication efforts.The target audience for the course includes those with an interest in gaining the technical expertise and leadership skills needed to work in global health and malaria programs around the world.The self-paced nature of the course will allow learners to access it at their convenience..Module 1: Setting the Stage for Malaria Elimination
The course begins with the “big picture.” In the lecture, Dr. Pedro Alonso, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Malaria Programme, offers an overview of the progress made—as well as challenges encountered – in malaria control and towards malaria elimination over the past decade. The module contextualizes these trends in WHO’s ongoing transition from promoting a one-size-fits-all strategy to tailoring approaches according to local and regional epidemiological, environmental, and political contexts.  Module 2: The Biology of Malaria
This module provides foundational scientific knowledge for the course, including important biological aspects of the malaria parasite, the mosquito vector, and the human host. In this module’s lecture, Professor Dyann F. Wirth begins with a brief overview of how malaria came to be understood, then goes into detail on the parasite’s life cycle, how malaria affects humans, and the existing and sought-after tools to prevent and treat malaria. Finally, Professor Wirth reviews global endeavors to eradicate malaria.  Module 3: Vector Biology and the Dynamics of Malaria Transmission
This module focuses on the Anopheles mosquitoes that are the vector that transmit malaria to humans. Professor Flaminia Catteruccia discusses biological and anatomical features of mosquitoes that influence how the parasite is acquired from humans, develops in the mosquito, and is transmitted back to humans. Professor Catteruccia then discusses how current vector control strategies work, why they fail, and how improved understanding of vector biology can lead to improved vector and parasite control strategies.   Module 4: The Dynamics of Malaria Transmission
In the fourth module, the course delves deeper into the malaria transmission cycle, including how it can be interrupted. Professor Matthias Marti examines the cycle of malaria parasite transmission between humans and mosquitoes, including mechanisms of parasite sequestration in the human body, and the life cycle of the parasite in the mosquito. The module then applies these concepts to examine the dynamics of infectiousness and transmission. Finally, natural transmission-blocking mechanisms are considered in the context of the ongoing development of vaccines against malaria.  Module 5: Genomic Approaches to Malaria Elimination
This course module introduces learners to the contributions of the burgeoning field of genomics to understanding and controlling malaria. After introducing key genetic principles, Dr. Sarah Volkman uses data on genetics from Senegal, Panama, and Mozambique to describe how parasite populations are changing. Currently available genomic tools and methods, along with their application to inform key questions about malaria transmission, prevention, and treatment, are discussed.  Module 6: Social, Cultural, Behavioral, and Environmental Determinants of Malaria
In the sixth module, the course’s focus shifts from the microscopic genes to a more global perspective. Using a systemic view of malaria, the module describes human and environmental factors that influence how malaria is manifested and how control efforts work. Professor Marcia Castro discusses various components of global ‘systems’ that enable the continued existence of malaria, and presents historical examples that exemplify the importance of these components. Professor Castro also describes the challenges and the opportunities in the struggle to eradicate malaria that these human and environmental factors create.  Module 7: Political Analysis for Malaria
In this module, the course presents another analytical approach that has been repeatedly shown to be necessary for successful malaria programming, as well as for public health more broadly. Professor Michael R. Reich approaches the topic of malaria control and eradication policy from the realm of politics. This module provides overviews of principles of applied political analysis and analysis methods that can be used to promote appropriate policy reforms. Professor Reich walks through the use of PolicyMaker, a free open-source political analysis software, analyzing case studies including one on the Affordable Medicines for Malaria Facility (AMFm).  Module 8: Malaria Control and Elimination: Surveillance-Response Approaches
This module discusses disease surveillance, a health system function essential to malaria elimination. Surveillance—finding where and when transmission of infectious diseases takes place—is critical for deciding where to target public health actions. In the lecture, Professor Marcel Tanner provides an in-depth examination of how to use monitoring and evaluation (M&E), surveillance-response, and data analysis effectively for malaria control and elimination. Using case studies from Zambia, China, the Pacific Islands and Tanzania, the module provides practical guidance on developing surveillance-response approaches and discusses how surveillance systems can be incorporated into public health programs.","Ecology, Epidemiology, Biology, Data Science, Leadership, Analytical Skills, Target Audience, Problem Solving, Decision Making",8 Weeks,Marcia Castro-Flaminia Catteruccia-Michael R.

Diseño de Jardines,Universidad Nacional de Córdoba,"Lo que éste curso pretende brindarles son herramientas básicas para el armado de éstos jardines en el espacio donde ustedes decidan realizarlo. Cualquier lugar en donde nosotros decidamos intervenir y que las plantas sean las protagonistas es un espacio verde. Ese espacio verde puede tener diferentes tamaños, y de acuerdo a eso, algunos criterios que nos permiten diferenciarlos son, si la superficie que involucra ese espacio verde es de más o de menos que una hectárea.Si son grandes superficies mayores a una hectárea, generalmente se habla de parques. Si son de menos de una hectárea y en general de uso residencial, urbano se habla de jardines.Hay jardines botánicos especializados que tienen mayor tamaño, y que se dedican a una actividad específica. Y otros jardines como los que ustedes van a poder desarrollar en su casa, en alguna institución educativa, o donde se lo soliciten, como un centro vecinal, por ejemplo, de menor tamaño, y generalmente esos son los que nosotros conocemos como jardines.En los jardines la protagonista es la vegetación. La vegetación es el conjunto de plantas, que en éste caso van a componer éste jardín. Para hablar de las plantas y saber cómo intervenir en un jardín, tenemos que recordar cuáles son las tres partes básicas de toda planta: raíces, tallo y las hojas y éstas hojas que se modifican y se transforman en flores que luego darán frutos, que en su interior van a contener la semilla que muchas veces vamos a usar para sembrar en nuestros jardines.De a poco vamos a ir viendo qué conviene hacer y cómo, en los distintos tipos de jardines que vamos a ir enseñando en éste curso.Los vamos a estar acompañando a lo largo de éste recorrido, para que el jardín que decidan hacer con la intencionalidad que ustedes le vayan a dar les permita conectarse nuevamente con la naturaleza, si es que estaban un pocodesconectados, revalorizar la flora en la que ustedes viven, y de alguna manera, volver hacer un uso más eficiente de los recursos naturales.Este curso está destinado a emprendedores y amantes de la naturaleza.¿Quieres tener una vida más sana, en armonía con el ambiente? Un jardín es un espacio en el que podemos darnos un momento con nosotros mismos, disfrutar de un ambiente puro en el que liberamos nuestra mente y espíritu, donde podemos regalarnos unos minutos de calma, ser creativos y compartir con nuestros seres queridos.En él, podremos encontrar un lugar para conectarnos con la naturaleza, al ver los insectos y las aves llegar, las plantas crecer, florecer y reverdecer...Si esto te es atractivo, es el momento de diseñar, construir y/o mantener tu propio jardín. En este curso te damos las claves para lograrlo, de manera sencilla, amigable y atractiva. Y por qué no, si quieres ayudar a otros a disfrutar de la naturaleza, puedes encontrar con estas orientaciones la forma de emprender un oficio.Los contenidos te enseñarán a preparar los suelos, a elaborar compost, a crear distintos tipos de jardines (acuáticos -en maceta o en estanque, xerofíticos, ornamentales, aromáticos, con césped) y a realizar el mantenimiento (corte, desmalezado y alcorque). ¡Te aseguramos que podrás lograr tus objetivos y, lo mejor, lo vas a disfrutar!.IntroducciónMódulo 1 : Preparación del suelo.

e-Learning on Digital Agriculture,World Bank Group,"Digital Agricultural Technologies (DATs) are innovations that enable farmers and agribusiness entrepreneurs to leapfrog to increase their productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness, facilitate access to markets, improve nutritional outcomes and enhance resilience to climate change. These technologies range from mobile apps to digital identities for farmers to solar applications for agriculture to portable agriculture devices. DATs are increasingly becoming indispensable in the global food and agriculture sector, from fast and convenient information delivery to providing virtual marketplaces. Considering the fact that digital technologies can accelerate agro-food outcomes is juxtaposed with low adoption rates of the same, the World Bank’s operations are increasingly incorporating digital agriculture as a critical element in its operations. Thus, it is important to study digital agriculture technologies in further detail.This five-week course will provide a high-level overview of DAT concepts, potential impact, range of technologies available, used cases as well as forward-looking technologies. The course will introduce the participants to different agriculture data platforms already available and will encourage them to discover the scope and utility of the open data platforms for analytics and intelligence in agriculture. Participants will be required to engage in discussion forums with their peers and complete quizzes throughout the course..This course runs for 5 weeks.Week 1: Overview of Digital AgricultureThe first module of this course outlines what ICTs and digital technologies are being used in agriculture and how. It will explore the key drivers of ICT-enabled services in agriculture as well as the lessons learned so far. The module also introduces the Principles of Digital Development established in 2017 to capture the shifting role of technologies in global development. The second section of the module spotlights the impact of mobile phones and mobile technologies on agriculture and rural development.Week 2: ICT and Digital Tools for Enhancing Productivity on the FarmIn the modules, they are two sections; first section focuses on their impact on on-farm productivity; the second section focuses on improving farming practices through extension and advisory services.Section 1: How can farmers and governments use ICT and digital tools to increase agricultural productivity? At the local level, farmers can use ICT to match cropping practices to climatic trends, use inputs and resources environmentally and sustainably, and cope with productivity threats. At the national level, public officials can adjust policies to reflect the data collected with ICT and digital tools, predict food supplies, target social programs, or promote yield technologies.Section 2: ICT and digital tools have the potential to transform extension and advisory services in several ways—including changing the way in which extension agents do their work, but also changing the ways extension institutions are organized and staffed. The emergence of public and private innovators and start-ups with business models built around ICT-enabled advisory services signals the types of transformations that are likely to come.Week 3: Empowering Smallholder Farmers through ICT/Digital Tools in Financial ServicesNew channels for delivering financial services (facilitated by ICT), new players, and greater competition enable service providers to offer a larger suite of financial products and services and acquire better financial information, some of which is useful for government regulation and policy development. A number of non-bank institutions have developed innovative approaches to financing agriculture, enabled by or integrated with ICT, including mobile financial services, branchless banking, ATMs, and smartcards.While the digital revolution is reaching rural areas in many developing countries, the rural-urban digital divide remains, and rural women face a triple divide: digital, rural, and gender. This module looks at the benefits of ICT when placed in the hands of men and women working in agriculture and rural areas. It examines the challenges that must be overcome and provides recommendations for rural communities to take full and equal advantage of ICT.Week 4: Strengthening Agricultural Market Access with ICT and Digital ToolsFarmers use mobile phones to build a network of contacts and draw on this wider expertise to obtain critical information more rapidly. The mobile phone, its special applications, and the Internet are essentially becoming management tools for farmers, especially in relation to market intelligence. Greater access to information helps farmers make better decisions about transportation and logistics, price and location, supply and demand, diversification of their product base, and access to inputs.ICT also facilitates market research, increasingly using live information. This market information strengthens farmers’ position in their day-to-day trading. Over time, market intelligence enables them to focus on satisfying consumers’ and buyers’ demands and on developing relationships with stakeholders in the next stage of the value chain. The key development challenge lies in assembling and disseminating this information in a timely manner, not just to traders or larger-scale farmers but also to smallholders.Week 5: Using ICT for Remote Sensing, Crowdsourcing, and Big DataThis module consists of three sections. (1) Remote sensing, (2) Crowdsourcing and crowd mapping, and (3) Big data for analytics:The first section , “Remote Sensing for Sustainable Agriculture,” focuses on the different types of geographical solutions that producers and others in agricultural value chains can use to increase efficiency, reduce waste, and ultimately bring about more sustainable agricultural practices.The second section on “Crowdsourcing and Crowd mapping: The Power of Volunteers,” focuses on how advances in social networking and data collection are enabling individuals to share hyperlocalized data in ways that have the potential to benefit society more broadly.The last section, “Big Data for Analytics,” focuses on how all of these agriculture-related data collected globally can be mined and analyzed in ways that lead to meaningful insights about how agriculture can be made more sustainable and productive.","Operations, Agriculture, Communications, Resilience, Solar Application, Technology Ecosystems",5 Weeks,OLC and SURR ,4.7,FREE-Add a Verified Certificate for Rs. 417.5,Introductory,https://www.edx.org/course/e-learning-on-digital-agriculture

Introducción a Matemáticas para Finanzas y Negocios,Tecnológico de Monterrey,"En la primera parte del curso se analiza el caso de las funciones lineales donde se introduce el concepto de pendiente para cuantificar la dependencia entre las variables. Este concepto se amplia al caso de ecuaciones simultáneas donde se analizan los modelos de equilibrio microeconómico (oferta y demanda de un producto) y macroeconómico (oferta y demanda agregada). Un diferenciador de este curso es el uso de matrices para resolver estos sistemas. Este enfoque permite expandir el análisis a la valuación de activos financieros mediante un portafolio replica e introducir el concepto más importante de finanzas: el Principio de No-arbitraje. En la segunda parte, el curso extiende el concepto de pendiente al caso de funciones no lineales mediante el uso de cálculo infinitesimal. Utilizando los conceptos de primera y segunda derivada se analizan aplicaciones como la Tasa Interna de Retorno y la toma de decisiones bajo incertidumbre aplicando la Desigualdad de Jensen. También se extiende la aplicación del concepto del Principio de No-Arbitraje a la valuación de instrumento de mercado de dinero y de bonos y anualidades. Finalmente se utiliza los conceptos de condiciones de primer y segundo orden para calcular el problema de maximización de ganancias de una empresa y la optimización de un portafolio de acciones.Entender la aplicación en finanzas y negocios de conceptos matemáticos como: pendiente, equilibrio, convergencia, matrices y vectores, condiciones de primer y segundo orden, convexidad, multiplicadores de Lagrange.Entender la diferencia entre la forma estructural y la forma reducida de un modelo.Utilizar el Principio de No-arbitraje para valuar instrumentos financieros como instrumentos de mercado de dinero, perpetuidades y anualidades.Entender la correcta formulación de problemas bajo incertidumbre considerando la convexidad o concavidad de la función objetivo.Entender las convenciones en el mercado de renta fija tales como composición y Day-Count para valuar un bono corporativo.Construir un portafolio eficiente a partir de un grupo de instrumentos de renta variable..Tema 1: Funciones Lineales1.1.

Caer o No caer. El Secreto de las Estructuras.,Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Las estructuras están implicadas en nuestras vidas: las plantas, los animales, casi todo lo que fabrica el ser humano, incluso nuestro propio cuerpo, deben soportar una serie de fuerzas sin romperse, y por lo tanto prácticamente cualquier elemento de nuestro entorno es una estructura de una clase u otra.No cabe duda de que entender cómo se comportan las estructuras es fundamental para entender el mundo que nos rodea, para comprender la naturaleza y para juzgar mejor los progresos que ha hecho la humanidad a lo largo de la historia. Sin embargo, los ingenieros hemos fallado una y otra vez cuando hemos intentado explicar esta materia de forma que los no entendidos puedan entender su importancia.Este curso pretende saltar esa brecha existente entre los expertos en cálculo de estructuras y los profanos utilizando un lenguaje asequible, empleando ejemplos históricos y proponiendo ensayos sencillos que pueden hacerse en casa. El curso abordará no sólo el problema de por qué los edificios y los puentes se caen sino también otras muchas cuestiones. ¿Por qué las ventanas de los aviones son redondas? ¿Por qué los gusanos tienen esa forma? ¿Por qué los murciélagos pueden volar dentro de un rosal sin rasgarse las alas? ¿Cómo funcionan las arterias? ¿Por qué las catedrales góticas pueden ser tan esbeltas? ¿Por qué hay construcciones romanas que siguen en pie 2000 años después? ¿Qué podemos aprender sobre los constructores de las diferentes estructuras que nos han legado nuestros antepasados?Muchos contenidos de este curso pueden ser útiles para médicos, biólogos, artistas, historiadores y arqueólogos.Lo que aprenderás:.Semana 1: Las grandes construcciones de la Antigüedad
Los menhires: la construcción más sencilla ¿o no tan sencilla? El dolmen: un gran paso para la humanidad. La piedra: la mejor amiga del constructor en la antigüedad. ¿Qué sabían de ingeniería los constructores de Stonehenge? ¿Qué nos enseña Stonehenge sobre sus constructores? ¿Por qué las primeras civilizaciones construyeron pirámides en todas las partes del mundo? ¿Qué nos enseñan las pirámides sobre sus constructores? ¿Cómo salvar una distancia? Semana 2: Del humilde Románico al grandioso Gótico
¿Qué materiales utilizar? Puentes colgantes: los puentes más antiguos y los más modernos. ¿Podemos subir a la Luna en ascensor? ¿Por qué no se caen los arcos? Mil ochocientos años transportando agua. ¿Qué nos enseña el acueducto sobre los romanos?. El humilde románico. El grandioso gótico. El genio de Gaudí. Semana 3: Salvar una distancia
Un momento, por favor. ¿En qué consiste ser flexible? La importancia de la geometría. Sobre Thomas Young. Más allá de Young. Un tipo peligroso: Pandeo. Puentes de récord. Cargas, fuerzas y reacciones ¿son lo mismo? Semana 4: Un techo sobre nuestras cabezas Las ingeniosas celosías.
Las sencillas bóvedas. ¿Cómo trabajan las bóvedas? Las grandiosas cúpulas. Placas y láminas ¿son lo mismo? ¿Cómo resistir un terremoto? Los secretos de las pagodas japonesas. Alcanzar el cielo. Semana 5: Estructuras que flotan: los barcos
El mar como fuente de alimento. El genio de Arquímedes. La conquista del mar. Más lejos, más rápido. Más lejos, más rápido aún. La revolución industrial. Luchar contra el agua. Semana 6: Estructuras que ruedan: los coches
La rueda: un invento redondo. Confort en ruta. Accidentes más seguros. Usa siempre el casco. Semana 7: Estructuras que vuelan: los aviones
¿Por qué vuela un avión? ¿Cómo hacer unas alas? Cuidado: torsión en las alas. Otras estructuras que vuelan. ¿De qué están hechos los aviones? Estructuras con aberturas. Semana 8: Ingeniería forense

"El manejo de plagas, malezas y enfermedades en los Sistemas de Siembra Directa",Universidad Nacional de Córdoba,"Las BPAs se definen como “el conjunto de principios, normas y recomendaciones técnicas, tendientes a reducir los riesgos físicos, químicos y biológicos en la producción, procesamiento, almacenamiento y transporte de productos de origen agropecuario, orientadas a asegurar la inocuidad del producto, la protección del ambiente y del personal involucrado, con el fin de propender al Desarrollo Sostenible. “Manual Agricultura Certificada AAPRESID” (Cobbe 2009)El Manejo Integrado de Plagas, o MIP, es la utilización de manera criteriosa y adecuada de todas las técnicas de tratamiento y manejo disponibles de los problemas sanitarios que afectan el cultivo. Desde el manejo de plagas y basándonos en las definiciones anteriormente mencionadas nos centraremos en definir el Monitoreo como un seguimiento secuencial en un período de tiempo, realizando muestreos de los mismos. Realizando un relevamiento y registro de la información “pertinente”, realizando hincapié en la información que realmente interese y sea relevante para el manejo de plagas, con el objetivo de definir el manejo sanitario de un cultivoNuestra gran limitante es el tiempo, cuando se releva la información se tiene un determinado tiempo de revisión de lotes, mientras los cultivos siguen avanzando, determinando hasta qué punto se sigue recopilando la información para mejorar el manejoDiferenciaremos entre Monitoreo, Visita y Muestreo, conceptos que no deben ser confundidos.Muestreo; selección de una pequeña parte, utilizada para inferir el valor de una o varias características delconjuntoVisita: productor o profesional va recabando datos relevantes, así como el personal encargado de sembrar, pulverizar o cosecharEl MONITOREO tiene como principal objeto entender la dinámica de problemas sanitarios en cultivos. Pero para que este objetivo se cumpla debe:Registrar información con frecuencia para que sea fidedigna.Realizarse durante un período temporal acorde a los objetivos de relevamiento.Limitar el espacio del cual se tomará información para el manejo.Requiere conocimiento profundo de los problemas sanitarios en los cultivos, la dinámica y dimensión de estos problemas.Pero para conocer a fondo las limitantes sanitarias de un cultivo, es primario conocer el “cultivo sano”Veremos cuáles son las ventajas de Monitorear, la importancia de registrar los datos para encontrar soluciones, ver la evolución y compartir con otros profesionales.En este curso aprenderemos a definir el Monitoreo como un seguimiento secuencial en un período de tiempo, realizando muestreos de los mismos.Mediante un relevamiento y registro de la información “pertinente”, realizando hincapié en la información que realmente interese y sea relevante para el manejo de plagas, con el objetivo de definir el manejo sanitario de un cultivo.Aprenderemos a identificar, cuantificar, conocer su biología, su estado, determinar su ubicación en el cultivo, conocer el coeficiente de daño o el nivel de pérdida que puede ocasionar al cultivo las plagas y organismos benéficos.Identificar los factores a tener en cuenta a la hora de realizar un muestreo.Implementar prácticas agronómicas que tiendan a reducir las poblaciones de plagas; Realizar un seguimiento frecuente de las poblaciones de las plagas, considerando el daño particular de cada una como así también los daños adicionales del conjunto, tomando en cuenta el estado fenológico y general del cultivo y las condiciones ambientales.Identificar, cuantificar, conocer su biología, su estado, determinar su ubicación en el cultivo, conocer el nivel de reducción que puede ocasionar a las plagas que atacan al cultivo.Tomar en cuenta información adicional sobre la posibilidad de aumento poblacional o aparición de plagas y enemigos naturales, valiéndose de todas las herramientas disponibles.Considerar debidamente el equilibrio entre las pérdidas económicas del cultivo y los costos/beneficios de la implementación de prácticas tendientes a la reducción de las plagas.En el caso de necesidad de realizar un control con fitosanitarios, elegir aquellos productos que actúen de manera específica contra las plagas en cuestión, con el menor impacto ambiental, instrumentando una correcta forma de aplicación y siguiendo las recomendaciones de un profesional..Módulo 1: Buenas pràcticas y manejo integrado de plagas en SD; conceptos y definiciones como base para desarrollar el Monitoreo.Módulo 2: Diagnóstico y monitoreo de lotes eje fundamental de una buena práctica.

Introducción a la caligrafía y paleografía en archivos hispanos medievales y modernos,Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"¿Desea comprender el contexto histórico de las culturas medievales hispánicas que crearon documentos como forma de comunicación manuscrita? ¿Le interesa alcanzar unas competencias profesionales para leer y escribir tipos históricos de letra? ¿Cómo comprender y poner en práctica los fundamentos de la caligrafía histórica y las reglas de paleografía utilizando técnicas, materiales, herramientas originales, métodos y principios?Este curso refleja un interés basado en los métodos colaborativos de aprendizaje que contextualizan las habilidades de lectura y escritura de los manuscritos medievales y modernos. Se inscribe dentro de los postulados de las humanidades digitales y busca la combinación de caligrafía y paleografía. Esta integración activa proporciona un conocimiento de calidad, superior a la mera reproducción aislada de letras o la mera transcripción paleográfica de los documentos. Se aprenderá caligrafía mientras se aprende paleografía y viceversa.Ambas disciplinas se juntan en este curso de forma sinérgica para hacer de este curso una respuesta formativa adecuada al estudio de la cultura manuscrita medieval y moderna.Este MOOC está especialmente orientado a profesionales de archivos y responsables de conservación y gestión de fondo antiguo dentro del patrimonio histórico documental. Estos expertos requieren un aprendizaje paleográfico esencial para poder alcanzar los objetivos de su trabajo con testimonios de la herencia cultural manuscrita.El curso está también pensado para calígrafos profesionales y para estudiantes de grado y posgrado con interés activo por la cultura manuscrita hispana desde el siglo IX hasta el XVIII..Semana 1: Introducción, Paleografía, Caligrafía y contexto cultural
Introducción a los conceptos básicos del curso, como la diferencia entre paleografía y caligrafía; y a los materiales y herramientas de la escritura. Se ofrece una visión global de la historia europea entre 800 y 1789. Semana 2: Alta Edad Media en Europa y España y su legado escrito (800-1000)
Tras examinar el contexto histórico, se procede al análisis y de las letras precarolina hispánica (visigótica) y carolina. Semana 3: La Baja Edad Media en Europa y España y su legado escrito (1000-1300 c.e.)
Se ofrece una visión de la historia europea de este período, en el que surge la escritura gótica. Se examina su importancia para la administración en las instituciones de la época. Se profundiza en el ciclo de Góticas tanto formadas librarias (textura) como documentales cursivas (letra de privilegios y letra de albalaes: morfología, análisis paleográfico y desarrollo caligráfico). Semana 4: La Baja Edad Media en Europa y España y su legado escrito (1300-1450 c.e.)
En este período las letras góticas cursivas tardías inician su evolución hacia la escritura humanística. Se profundiza en las letras precortesana y cortesana: morfología, análisis paleográfico y desarrollo caligráfico. Semana 5: Los “largos siglos XVI-XVII” en Europa y España: desarrollo caligráfico (1450-1640 c.e.)
El Renacimiento, además de provocar cambios culturales, religiosos y políticos cruciales, culmina la transición de las formas escritas medievales a las humanísticas. Es la Edad de Oro de la caligrafía en Europa. Dentro de la Corona de España, se profundiza en las letras procesal y en la gótica redonda así como en diferentes tipos de humanística cursiva. Semana 6: La Edad Moderna en España y Europa: su influencia caligráfica (1640-1789)
La evolución histórica de este periodo produce cambios en la burocracia y, por lo tanto, en la caligrafía. Aparecen las escrituras ornamentales del Barroco.","Communications, Integration, Writing, Hispanic And Latino Culture, Management, Digital Humanities, Collaborative Learning, Innovation, Transcribing, Collections",6 Weeks,Diego Navarro Bonilla-José Luis La Torre Merino-Eduardo Juárez Valero,4.5,FREE-Add a Verified Certificate for Rs. 2421.5,Introductory,https://www.edx.org/course/introduccion-a-la-caligrafia-y-paleografia-en-arch

Introducción a los ritmos y relojes biológicos,Universidad Nacional de Córdoba,"En este curso en línea aprenderás sobre el reloj y el ritmo biológico, y su impacto en nuestra salud y en nuestro diario vivir. El reloj biológico es la respuesta del cuerpo humano (fisiología) a diferentes etapas del día, este reloj biológico es aquel que le dice al cuerpo que debe estar despierto durante el día y descansar en la noche. Losritmos biológicoshan surgido en respuesta ala alternancia entre el día y la noche, y las estaciones. La cronobiología es la ciencia que estudia los ritmos biológicos; los cambios de nuestro reloj. Este curso en línea te ayudará a conocer tu reloj biológico y el impacto que los factores externos tienen en él, esto es importante ya que puede ayudarte a mejorar tu calidad de vida. Acaso¿no han sentido alguna vez que poseemos un reloj interno, que nos despierta por la mañana antes que suene el despertador?,¿o que nos avisa cuando sentimos apetito, y descubrimos que ya es hora de almorzar?,¿o al sentirnos cansados, tarde en la noche, percibimos que necesitamos ir a dormir? Estas y muchas otras actividades que realizamos a diario; sueño, apetito, actividad/reposo, estudio, trabajo, etc., como así también procesos biológicos que ocurren en nuestro organismo; producción de hormonas, temperatura corporal, metabolismo, cambian rítmicamente a lo largo del día. Estos cambios constituyen los ritmos biológicos y aquellos que presentan un periodo cercano a las 24 horas se denominan“circadianos”(del latín, circa: cercano, diano: día). Losritmos biológicoshan surgido en respuesta a los cambios cíclicos del medio ambiente que nos rodea: la alternancia día/noche, las estaciones, es por esto que los organismos vivos contamos con un sistema denominado sistema o ritmo circadiano que permite medir el tiempo internamente, adaptarnos a tales cambios ambientales que ocurren a lo largo del día, y anticiparnos a la llegada de los mismos. Efectivamente losrelojes biológicosse encuentran distribuidos a lo largo de todo el organismo. Estos relojes internos regulan diversas funciones fisiológicas y conductuales con un periodo cercano a las 24 horas pero no exactamente de 24 horas, por eso se hace necesario ajustarlos diariamente a través de señales externas del medio ambiente: luz, temperatura, alimentación, etc. La luz constituye la señal externa más potente para sincronizar el reloj central ubicado en el cerebro. Una vez sincronizado este reloj, envía señales al resto del organismo para coordinar las actividades de forma rítmica..Introducción: La vida en la Tierra se originó y evolucionó en un ambiente cíclico como consecuencia de la rotación de nuestro planeta sobre su eje y alrededor del sol, lo que ocasiona la alternancia día/noche a lo largo de las 24 horas y con estos los ciclos de luz/oscuridad, como así también las estaciones y los marcados cambios en la duración del día y la noche, en la cantidad e intensidad de luz, e importantes variaciones en la temperatura a lo largo del día/noche y las estaciones. Durante muchos años hemos conocido que los organismos vivos, incluyendo los humanos, contamos con un reloj biológico interno que nos permite medir el tiempo interno. Pero, ¿cómo funciona realmente este reloj? Módulo 1: Historia de la Cronobiología. Conceptos Básicos de la Cronobiología. Reloj y Ritmos Biológicos.

Introducción a las ondas gravitacionales,Universidad Nacional de Córdoba,"En este curso conocerás sobre las ondas gravitacionales de forma fácil y enseñado por una experta del proyecto LIGO; Gabriela González. Algunos de los temas que cubriremos: • Los astrónomos modernos combinan datos de múltiples tipos de telescopios para crear imágenes compuestas de objetos en el espacio. • Los agujeros negros son por definición imposibles de observar directamente usando telescopios de luz, ya que ninguna luz puede escapar de su extrema gravedad. • La única manera de estudiar los agujeros negros usando telescopios de luz es observar cualquier gas y polvo que caiga en ellos. Esto puede revelar información sobre un agujero, como la frecuencia con la que gira alrededor de su eje. Comprensión de la gravedad. • En el siglo XVII, Isaac Newton propuso una ley universal de gravitación que concebía la gravedad como una fuerza entre dos masas (m1m1 y m2m2) separadas por una distancia rr según la ecuación: F = Gm1m2r2F = Gm1m2r2 • La teoría de Newton es muy exacta para la mayoría de las situaciones y es ampliamente utilizada hoy en día. Sin embargo, Newton estaba preocupado por la acción a distancia, quería entender cómo dos masas se conocen y se influyen mutuamente sin enviar ninguna señal. • Este problema no se resolvió hasta que Albert Einstein propuso la relatividad general en 1916. En su nueva concepción la gravedad no es una fuerza, sino la geometría del espacio-tiempo. Los objetos masivos causan que el espacio-tiempo se curve, y esta curvatura es lo que influye en el movimiento de otros objetos en el espacio-tiempo. El mensajero gravitacional de Newton resultó ser el espacio-tiempo en sí. • Einstein se dio cuenta de que objetos masivos (no esféricamente simétricos) sometidos a aceleración u oscilación producirían distorsiones que se extenderían a través del espacio-tiempo como ondulaciones en un estanque. Estas ondulaciones se llaman ondas gravitacionales. • Al igual que las ondas electromagnéticas, las ondas gravitatorias transportan energía y tienen amplitudes (llamadas tensión para las ondas gravitacionales) y frecuencias asociadas con ellas. Las ondas gravitatorias se representan a menudo como formas de onda, que demuestran su frecuencia y amplitud mientras que cambian con el tiempo. • Las ondas gravitacionales interactúan muy débilmente con la materia, pasando por todo esencialmente sin cambios. Esto es muy útil para la astronomía porque significa que cualquier señal detectada permanece prácticamente inalterada desde cuando se generó en la fuente.Hace no mucho tiempo, hace apenas un par de años, anunciamos en el 2016, que habíamos descubierto por primera vez ondas gravitacionales. En introducción a ondas gravitacionales vamos a explicar su significado, son una predicción de la teoría de Einstein de la teoría de la relatividad general, vamos hablar de la primera teoría de la relatividad especial después de la relatividad general y de cómo se producen o cómo pensaba Albert Einstein que se producían las ondas gravitacionales. Después vamos a hablar de qué sistemas producen ondas gravitacionales, en realidad no sabemos producir nosotros ondas gravitacionales, sabemos que hay sistemas astrofísicos que producen las ondas gravitacionales. Es así que hablaremos de agujeros negros, de estrellas de neutrones, del universo temprano produciendo ondas gravitacionales. Más tarde hablaremos de cómo se pueden detectar las ondas gravitacionales, que ha sido una campaña muy difícil que ha tomado casi medio siglo; Pero hay detectores de distintos tipos, vamos a explicar los distintos tipos de detectores, y más en detalle los detectores que se usaron para detectar por primera vez, por segunda y por tercera vez, también, ondas gravitacionales. Y finalmente, el tema más interesante, es la astrofísica de las ondas gravitacionales que aprendemos porqué las buscamos, y cómo podemos aprender de los sistemas que las producen, no solo midiendo ondas gravitacionales con distintos instrumentos, sino también midiendo otras ondas, ondas electromagnéticas, u otras partículas producidas por los mismos sistemas..Introducción: En este curso vamos a hablar de las ondas gravitacionales. Hace no mucho tiempo, hace apenas un par de años, anunciamos en el 2016, que habíamos descubierto por primera vez ondas gravitacionales. Vamos a explicar primero qué son, son una predicción de la teoría de Einstein de la teoría de la relatividad general, vamos hablar de la primera teoría de la relatividad especial después de la relatividad general y de cómo se producen o cómo pensaba Einstein que se producían las ondas gravitacionales. Módulo 1: En este módulo vamos aprender la teoría de la relatividad general de Einstein, que suena muy difícil, pero vamos a aprender lo básico lo que hace falta para entender cómo se producen y cómo se predicen las ondas gravitacionales. Módulo 2: ¿Qué es lo que produce ondas gravitacionales? De acuerdo a la teoría, cualquier masa que no sea esférica y este acelerándose produce ondas gravitacionales. Yo misma aquí estoy produciendo ondas gravitaciones, la cuestión es ¿qué sistemas producen ondas gravitacionales detectables? Módulo 3: En este módulo vamos hablar de cómo se detectan las ondas gravitacionales, ¿cuál es el efectos que queremos detectar? Lo que queremos hacer es medir distancias de manera muy precisa. Tenemos muchas maneras de medir distancias, aún distancias a estrellas; cuán precisamente necesitamos medirlas, esa es la cuestión. ¿Cuán grande es la distorsión del espacio tiempo? Módulo 4: Y finalmente, el tema más interesante, es la astrofísica de las ondas gravitacionales que aprendemos porqué las buscamos, y cómo podemos aprender de los sistemas que las producen, no solo midiendo ondas gravitacionales con distintos instrumentos, sino también midiendo otras ondas, ondas electromagnéticas, u otras partículas producidas por los mismo sistemas.","Amplitudes, Influencing Skills, Astronomy, Voltage, Electromagnetic Waves, Geometry",4 Weeks,Gabriela González,4.522,FREE-Add a Verified Certificate for Rs. 4175.0,Introductory,https://www.edx.org/course/introduccion-a-las-ondas-gravitacionales
